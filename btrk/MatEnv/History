History (Reverse alphabetical order, please):

2010-01-15 R. Stroili
	- split code in src and include directories

V00-05-06 2007-9-12 A. Cervelli
        - Fixed material weight for svt-SimFanOut material  

V00-05-05 2007-08-29: M. Kelsey
	- Fix typo (extra decimal point) in MaterialsList_IR2.data
	- Change "1901" to "1971" in all three *_sequence.dat files, to work
	  around a DST problem with Linux 2.4 kernel machines <URL:
          http://babar-hn.slac.stanford.edu:5090/HyperNews/get/condmgmt/266/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/2/1/1/1/2/1/1.html>.

V00-05-03 2007-08-03: Alberto Cervelli (note added 29Aug2007 MHK)
	- MaterialsList_IR2.data:  added svt-SimFanOut material
	  (fanout+glue) to be used in the Svt simulation, and svt-RecoWafer
	  (fanout+glue+silicon) to be used in the reconstruction for the Svt

[ No notes for V00-05-01 or V00-05-02 ]

V00-05-00 2005-05-16: Jane Tinslay
        - Split MatEnv into MatEnv and MatEnvP to separate out
          objy dependence. Also shift objy independent classes
          from MatReco to MatEnv.

V00-02-00 2003-09-09: Andy Salnikov
	_very_ late CDB migration:
	- BdbCondLoadList replaced with CdbBdbLoadList in MathEnvLoad.cc
	- three proxy classes now take strategy object in their ctors
	- dictionariy classes give "fixed time" strategy when they make
	  proxies

V00-01-05 2003-06-20: Andy Salnikov
	CdbBdbInit module moved to a different package, changes to includes
	and dependiencies.

V00-01-02 05-Jun-2002 Gapon
Migrated to CDB API. All three proxies have been reimplemented
as subclasses of the CdbBdb/CdbBdbEnvProxy base class. The .cc
files of the former implementations have been removed.
The transaction management of the MatEnvLoad loader has been replaced
to use the new CdbBdb/CdbBdbTransaction class.
The link_<package>.mk extended to include Cdb* libraries.
The AppUserBuild class has been extended to include the CDB initialization
module BdbModules/CdbBdbInit into the application's sequence.

V00-00-41 22-Jan-2001 Lockman
Mat*Dictionary::fill*Dict: copy objects into dictionary rather than just
storing their pointers to avoid potential memory corruption (one factory
faulting the DB will invalidate the pointers in the dictionaries owned by
the other factories). Add clearAnd Destroy in dtor. 
Changes are to .cc files only.

V00-00-40 12-Jan-2001 Lockman
- Convert ErrLog::blah to ErrMsg(enum).
- *Proxy.cc: fatal error AbsArgCast<BdbTime>::value(timearg) returns a null
  BdbTime pointer
- Mat*List::Mat*List(infile) : fatal error if infile is null

V00-00-39 11-Jan-01 Lockman
- Mat(Elm,Mtr,Iso)Dictionary.cc: 
o remove extern IfdProxyDict* gblPEnv, it is already defined in AbsEnv.
o fatal error if Proxy can't be stored in Env or List can't be obtained from 
  Env.
o Warn if BdbTime 'now' is being used

V00-00-38-02 04-Jan-01 Lockman
- includes the updates to Mat*Proxy to support multiple federations, but the
  Mat*Dictionaries access the database with a BdbTime of 'now', as in tag
  V00-00-35-01.

V00-00-38-01 12-Dec-00 Lockman
- updated V00-00-38 with mods in V00-00-35-01.

V00-00-35-01 12-Dec-00 Lockman
- added pep-Vac to MaterialsList.data, MaterialsList_IR2.data, 
  MaterialsList_MC_1.data. It is air at P = 10**-9 torr. Based on V00-00-35

V00-00-35 18-Nov-2000 Stephen J. Gowdy
- Add include of iostream.h to MatIsotopeObj.cc, perviously included
  indirectly.

V00-00-34 ????

V00-00-29 24-Nov-1999 S.H.Robertson
- Corrected radiation length of pep-Gold and pep-Nickel in MaterialsList.data.
  Old values were entered in cm rather than g/cm^2

V00-00-28 Contributed by Romosan
- some linux related mods

V00-00-27 Contributed by Akbarm
- Deep copy mods to persistent objects (I think)

V00-00-26 Contributed by Gowdy
- Makefile mods

V00-00-25 23-Aug-1999 T.L. Geld
- Updated MaterialsList.data for pep simulation:
  Changed gnbpip materials which used G3 default elements to new pep-*
  elements.  Added pep-Tungsten, pep-Iron, pep-Lead, pep-Copper, plus
  pep-Tantulum for future use.  Did *NOT* change VACUUM default, seems
  to be some problem getting tracks though a pep-Vacuum material based
  on vacuum already defined in MaterialsList.data.
- Requires gnbpip V00-05-08.

V00-00-24 ??

V00-00-23 26-May-1999 Talby
- added 2 new materials for Ifr in MaterialsList.data
  ifr-Aluminum and ifr-Copper 

V00-00-22 14-May-1999 Lockman, Talby
- GNUmakefile: specify binary product in BINS list rather than bins: 
- Updates values of rad. and Nucl. int lengths for emc-CsI from 
  -10 -20 (unavailable) to values available on PDG98. Modification 
  in MaterialsList.data

V00-00-21 27-April-1999 M. Talby  
- Protection to avoid putting transient material lists in the environment 
  more than one time (this happens only if more than one factory are 
  invoked in a job). Protection in MatIsoDictionary, MatElmDictionary 
  and MatMatDictionary.
- replace "cout" used for error messages by the ErrLog handler.

V00-00-20 25-March-1999 M. Talby  
- Fixed memory leakage pb in MatIsotopeListP, MatElementListP and 
  MatMaterialListP

V00-00-19 12-March-1999 M.Talby (changes and message by D. Quarrie)
- fixes a problem that was introduced by David Quarrie by deleting 
  what I thought was the obsolete Registered Package Schema Declarations 
  header file from the BdbUtil, having inadequately checked for dependent 
  packages. Since this is in fact obsolete, I've removed references to 
  it from this package. There are no other functional changes to this 
  package.

V00-00-18 29-January-1999 M. Talby  
- Changed "bp" to "pep" (TLA) for beam pipe materials in MaterialsList.data
- Added "pep-Beryllium" in MaterialsList.data
- Changed "dirc" to "drc" (TLA) for dirc materials in MaterialsList.data
- Cosmetics: after TLA subsystem name, material name begins with a Capital 
  letter.

V00-00-17 29-January-1999 M. Talby  
- Modified "bp-SS3316L" -> "bp-SS316L" in MaterialsList.data
- New materials added in MaterialsList.data: "dirc-Air", "svt-Resin"
  "svt-Hardner", "svt-Epoxy", "svt-Kevlar", "svt-Berg".

V00-00-16 28-January-1999 M. Talby  
- BdbTime migration: "BdbCond/BdbTime.hh" -> "BdbTime/BdbTime.hh" in 
  MatIsoDictionary.cc, MatElmDictionary.cc and MatMtrDictionary.cc 
  "BdbCond/BdbIntervalBase.hh" -> "BdbTime/BdbIntervalBase.hh" in 
  MatIsotopeListProxy.cc, MatElementListProxy.cc and MatMaterialListProxy.cc.

V00-00-15 19-January-1999 M. Talby  
- Added "#include <stdlib.h>" in MatMaterialList.cc, MatMaterialObj.cc, 
  MatMaterialObjP.cc and TestRCondDB.cc. Contains "abs" template.

V00-00-14 19-January-1999 M. Talby  
- Replaced "fabs" by "abs" in MatMaterialList.cc, MatMaterialObj.cc, 
  MatMaterialObjP.cc and TestRCondDB.cc. "fabs" was used on integers! 
  this triggers compilation errors on HP but not Sun or OSF!.

V00-00-13 15-December-1998 M. Talby  
- fixed error in the ifr-RPCgas input data

V00-00-12 15-December-1998 M. Talby (a fix from Gilbet Grosdidier) 
- Fixed syntax problem in 2 ddl files: MatElementObjP.ddl MatMaterialObjP.ddl.
  The inheritance from BdbObject was not declared "public" in these two files,
  hence it was "private" by default, forbidding access to base class method.
  This was failing at compile time on HP-UX. 
- Added ifr-RPCgas to the materials list. 

V00-00-11 8-December-1998 M. Talby 
- Added ifr materials in MaterialsList.data 
  README modified accordingly

V00-00-10 25-November-1998 M. Talby
- Add README file in the package. 
- Add dirc-Aluminum in MaterialsList.data
 
V00-00-09 20-November-1998 G.Cosmo
- Removed "virtual" qualifier from transient() methods in all schemas,
  to allow correct initializiation of virtual table.
- Added "air" non specific subdetector material to the materials list.
- Added MatEnv.tcl to run in conjuction with AppUseBuild to load and test
  the database.

V00-00-08 18-November-1998 Mossadek Talby
- GNUmakefile: Remove TestRCondDB.cc from the library.
  Few modifications in MaterialsList.data

V00-00-07 16-November-1998 Mossadek Talby
- Schema migration introducing two new data members in MatMaterialObj(P) 
  classes. MaterialsList.data file modified accodingly.

V00-00-06 27-Oct-1998 Mossadek Talby
- New classes MatIsoDictionary, MatElmDictionary and MatMtrDictionary : 
  copy Isotopes, Elements and Materials transient list into dictionaries.
  This to allow accesse to Isotopes, Elements and Materials infos via a 
  key. 
- IsotopesList.data and ElementsList.data: mis-typing fixes.

V00-00-05 18-Oct-1998 D. Quarrie
- add named schema support.

V00-00-04 16-Oct-1998 D. Quarrie
- GNUmakefile: specify the DDL processing sequence explicitly 
  as suggested by D. Quarrie (see OO DB HyperNews 278 of 14 Oct. 98).

V00-00-03 14-Oct-1998 Mossadek Talby
- MaterialsList.data: more materials added (still not complete)
  link_MatEnv.mk: add link to rw and Objy (needed for compilation on OSF)

V00-00-02 09-Oct-1998 Mossadek Talby
- MatElemenList.cc and MatMaterialList.cc: a bug fix to read correctly the 
  components of each element and each material
- MatElementObj(P).cc (.hh) and MatMaterialObj(P).cc (.hh): use .insert to 
  fill out RWTValOrderedVector vectors
- MaterialsList.data: add new material infos (this file is not yet complete) 

V00-00-01 02-Oct-1998 Mossadek Talby
- GNUmakefile: modified to work properly with PackageList
- MatMaterialObj.hh, MatElementObj.hh: modified set methods to set class 
  variables properly

V00-00-00 29-Sep-1998 Mossadek Talby
- initial commit
