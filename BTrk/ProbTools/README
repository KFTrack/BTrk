ProbTools package - contains probability tools, including the
consistency class, etc.

Initial package coordinator is Bob Jacobsen, but he's
looking to get rid of it.

Note the probab.* routines are to be merged into 
the chisq-consistency support, then removed.

probab.* was originally in Beta/probab*, and a migration
.hh file is probably present there now (late March 97)

Jan 15 2010: R. Stroili
    split code in src and include directories

June 14 2002: Jane Tinslay
    RW migration

TAG V00-01-19--------------
Feb 15 2001: Eric C
  - Added ProbTools_LinkDef.rdl file to control cint dictionary generation

Nov 21 2000: Eric C
  - Added LIBEXTRARDLFILES line to GNUmakefile
 
June 27 2000: Andy S
  - add explicit casting of double to int in PoissonConsistency to avoid
    warnings from gcc
  - remove debugging printount in PoissonConsistency
  - add unistd.h in consistencyTest.cc which is needed for Linux to get 
    getopt() declaration

June 27 2000: Andy S
  - update of NumRecipes::gammln() for the book's version
  - rewritten PoissonConsistency's calculation of significance
    level
  - updated consistencyTest for changes in PoissonConsistency

July 4th 1999: Phil S
	Fix up bug in CombinedConsistency when noMeasure is 
	reported by all systems
	Add functions to AbsLikelihoodFraction to do 
	relative likelihoods (and logs thereof) with status
	checks on the calculation. 
	Fix up GaussConsistency, AsymGaussConsistency to 
	return values from calc() (hmm.. not sure what they 
	were doing before!).
	Remove unecessary return in probab.cc

March 23:  Migrating the Consistency classes. 
  Step 1: Copy and commit - they exist in libBaBar.a and 
          libProbTools.a
  Step 2: After release includes ProbTools, remove from
          libBaBar, add migration .hh
  Step 3: remove migration .hh
