Package coordinators: snyder,pallas,lockman

Package |BField| contains classes, functions and subroutines related
to modeling the BaBar magnetic field.

Added differential versions of bFieldZ and bFieldVect functions in
BField.cc--these are called bFieldZDF and bFieldVectDF. 

More persistent field support: 

Add:

bfldfrng.inc/F         Common block for the sdip, zdip, xdip and ydip
                       variables used in bfieldfringe.F, plus accessor
		       functions.

BFieldFringeInfo.hh/cc  Small object to hold strength/z information about
			fringe field.

BFieldFringeDB.hh/cc	BFieldFringe, but gets its data from BFieldP.

Modified:

BFieldBBSimDB.hh/cc  	Small bug fixes.

BFieldSol.hh/cc		Capable of being constructed entirely from objects.

bfieldfringe		Uses bfldfrng.inc.

Modifications for persistent field support:  Phil Strother 25/3/99

Add:

bfld.inc
bcoil.inc    		Include files for bfld, bcoil common blocks.
bfld.F, bcoil.F  	Accessor functions for above common blocks.  Necessary
                 	to load data into common blocks from Objy. 

gufld96_nofile.F 	Same as gufld96, but does not load constants from file.

BFieldPoint.hh/cc    	Small object to contain field and position information.

BFieldRZInfo.hh/cc	Small object (struct, almost) to contain r,z geometry information

BFieldBBSimDB.hh/cc	BField subclass designed to be constructed from DB information.

Modified:

BFieldBbsim, BFieldDipole, BFieldLoop, BFieldMonopole, BFieldPoly, BFieldQuadrapole
			Add a virtual destructor.

gufld96.F 		Change to use bfld.inc, bcoil.inc

GNUmakefile 		Updates to use PackageList style linking exclusively 
			Requires CPEUtils pds250399a, TopDraw pds250399a, 
			modifications to PackageList (not yet includable) to 
			work.  

V00-00-03 Tue Dec 09, 1997 Lockman

GNUmakefile: put the fortran .o files in libBFieldF.a, the C++ in libBField.a.
This allows bbsim to link on AIX.

Tue Nov 11 11:24:29 PST 1997

o New object - |BFieldSuprPos| - which superimposes a list of 
  |BField|s.   Needed for studying effect of disturbances to the 
  field (such as   residual dipole component to beam line magnetics) 
  on tracking.

o New |BFieldDipole| implements a dipole field. Constructor takes
  three arguments:

  BFieldDipole
  (const HepPoint& where          //where the dipole is
   const HepVector& direction     //direction dipole points
   double strength);              //strength of dipole

note: |direction| is just used as direction, i.e., a unit
      vector is formed from it whether it is unit vector itself
      or not.

note: |strength| specifies the field strength 100 cm in front
      of the dipole.

Code is based on eqno. 4.13 in an ancient addition of Jackson.


o New class |BFieldMonopole|. Could be useful modeling field
  near pole dips, but probably isn't. See header for usage.

o New class |BFieldQuadrapole| is - what else - a quadrapole field.
  The arguments are:

  BFieldQuadrapole
  (const HepPoint& where          //where quadrpole is
   const HepMatrix& q             //quadrapole moments
   double strength);              //scale factor

  Note: in this case |q| has NOT been normalized to a unit 
  something, so both the magnitudes of |q| and |strength| can
  be used to set out strong the field is. This maybe changed
  if we can come up with a reasonable definition of unit |q|.

Thu Jan 14 2010 - R. Stroili
o split code in src and include directories

Mon Nov 10 11:05:03 PST 1997

o Removed |trajChange| function from base class |BField|. This
  needs to be re-implemented as part of some trajectory class.

o Explicitly turn off beam pipe field in |gusetfld|. Note: effects
  of beamline elements do leak in to tracking volume, so this
  is not a long term solution, but should be ok for the current
  level of simulation.

Fri Aug 22 13:31:50 PDT 1997 - A. Snyder
-sort out problems with |BFieldBbsim| getting wrong version of |gufld_|.
 Note when links are specified for this directory or a descendent dedicated
 to magnetic fields they need to be structure so that |libgnbbg.a| is
 searched before |libgeant321.a|; in fact it would be better if all magnetic
 field routines - simulation and reconstruction - where moved to their
 own packages. 

 Name of routine to setup magnetic field from c++-land has been changed to
 |gusetfld_|.


Fri Jul 18 16:30:01 PDT 1997 - A. Snyder
- Fixed bug in |BFieldPoly.cc| and parameter file |bbsimPoly.par| which
  contains polynomial parameters for a fit to the |bbsim| field in
  release 4.03. 

Wed Dec 31 11:38:43 PST 1997 - A. Snyder

o Generalize |momentum| functions for non-uniform field and make them
  non-virtual (all momentum calculation are the same).

o Add new class |BFieldLoop| which models field due to a rectangular
  loop of wire and also allows for the possibility that ends
  arch out of the plane of the loop. Based on fortran
  code from W. Dunwoodie.

Thu Jan 29 10:19:05 PST 1998

o New class |BFieldTrim| in realization of W. Dunwoodie's q1 trim model
  with addition of ability to specify its location and orientation 
  arbitrarily. Internal geometry of trim coils is, however, hard-wired.

o |testBField| has various menu driven test options; currently these
  compare |BFieldLoop| and |BFieldTrim| to fortran originals and, also,
  allow original fortran code to be run.

o De-virtualize |bFieldZ| and just have it return |bFieldVect().z()|.

o |BFieldTrim.button| is button macro for comparing |BFieldTrim| to
  |trimbField.F|. Use:

testBfield < BFieldTrim.button


Sun Feb 22 14:25:25 PST 1998

o Added |speedup| options to |BFieldTrim|. |speedup=0| is full
  coil model. It is the default. |speedup=1| approximates the
  number of turns in the horizontal and vertical trims by 10 and
  increase the current by ratio of true number of turns to 10 to
  get approximately. same field far from the coil. Other speed up modes may
  be added in the future, e.g., table look-up.

Thu Feb 26 14:27:26 PST 1998

o New class |BFieldFixed| gives a fixed arbitrary field. Constructor is
  |BFieldFixed(double Bx, double By, double Bz)|. Useful in testing
  sensitivity of tracking to systematic errors in field.

Sat Feb 28 17:15:57 PST 1998

o Put back |libBFieldF| to hold fortran routines in a separate library.

Thu Apr  2 11:43:13 PST 1998

o new test options for testing non-uniform field transport algorithms.
  |checkLinTransport.cc| is routine to do this.

o Changes to deal with new form of |HepTuple|s.

Wed Apr  8 09:50:55 PDT 1998

o New class |BFieldIntegrator| integrates a trajectory
  through a field after subtracting of a nominal value
  supplied by |BField|. Setup and call as follows:

BFieldIntegrator anIntegrator(currentField);

Hep3Vector dMom=deltaMomentum(aTraj,range);

where |aTraj| is pointer to a |Trajectory| and
|range| is array with lower and upper integration 
bounds (or optionally two doubles (lo,up) can be
specified separately).

o New function |bFieldNominal()| added to |BField|.
  By defaults to |bFieldZ()| (Bz at origin) but
  can be modified with |setNominalField(double)|.

Thu Jun  4 15:26:05 PDT 1998

o Modified |BFieldIntegrator::divideRange| do return
  zero'th point too.

o Add new static variables:

double _stepFrac;      //step size is this fraction of radius
double _stepCeiling;   //a ceiling on step size

o Can be set with functions:

void setStepFrac(double)
void setStepCeiling(double)

o Can be obtained from

double stepFrac()
double stepCeiling()


Wed Jun 24 15:07:32 PDT 1998

o |mode=6| to check accuracy of Dave Brown 
linear approximation at mid step added to
|checkLinTransport.cc|.

Thu Jun 25 16:48:37 PDT 1998

o add mode=100 to select user supplied special field
|gufldsp|. Default version of this routine creates
field with B_x=0, B_y=0.01, B_z=1.5.

o |gufldsp| is called for |fld_flg_run.ge.100|.

Thu Jul  2 15:08:51 PDT 1998

o New factory calls for manufacturing |BField|s added. It
is called |BFieldMaker|. See HEADER file for usage.


Mon Sep 14 16:09:32 PDT 1998

o |bfieldfringe| is Bill Dunwoodie's dipole approximation to B1-Q1
fringe fields.

o |bfieldsol| is interface to Adam Boyarski's polynomial plus dipoles
approximation of the solenoidal field. It is based on a fit to the
measurements.

o |BFieldFringe| is a c++ cover for |bfieldfringe.cc|.


Tue Sep 15 14:50:34 PDT 1998
 
o Dunwoodie routines |q1trimfield| and |coilpair| added for use
with |bbsim|.

Wed Sep 16 16:05:57 PDT 1998

o new routine |gufldmd| to implement reconstruction like field
models in |bbsim|. This is called within |gufldsp| when |fld_flg_run.ge.200|.
See comments in |gufldmd.F| for specific models available.

Thu Sep 17 11:19:03 PDT 1998

o new class |BFieldInterpolate| to do Maxwellian interpolation. 

Usage:

Either construct from field at reference point plus 5 linear 
coefficients or feed if a field, reference point and scale and
|BFieldIntegrator| will calculate the coefficients.

Argument of |bFieldVect| is always in relative to reference
point. 

o New class |BFieldSol| is cover on |bfieldsol.F| which is in
turn interface to A. Boyarski's polynomial+Bessel+dipole fit
to the solenoid's field. Note: this does not include effects
of Q1 trim coils or Q1/B1 fringe field nor is does it
include modification of field due to magnetic material
in Q1 and B1.

o At this point |bfieldsol.F| is just a place holder. Actual 
code will be put in soon.

Mon Sep 21 14:09:55 PDT 1998

o Add class |BFieldGrid| to hold a grid of fields; typically
each grid point would be a |BFieldInterpolator| and 
constructor to create such a grid is provided. A |BFieldGrid|
might contain another |BFieldGrid| in regions where finer
segmentation is needed.

o Somewhat worried about coordinate systems transforms in
|BFieldTrim| though in principle they are ok. Need to be 
checked again at some point.

Wed Sep 23 10:41:40 PDT 1998

o |trimfield.F| is version of |q1trimfield| to be called from
c++. Basically, slightly more modular with alignment and current
conventions handled in c++ instead of hardwired in. 

o Change |BFieldTrim| to call |trimfield_|. This should resolve
any coordinate system confusion.

Thu Sep 24 10:53:20 PDT 1998

o |coilpair| modified to take coordinate of beginning of quadrapole
as an argument rather than hardwired data statement. Corresponding
changes made to |q1trimfield.F| (hardwired original for use in
|bbsim|) and |trimfield.F| (local quad coordinate system version
used in c++ -- where Dch alignment must be coped with).


o New function |checkInterpolator| to run test on |BFieldInterpolate|
and |BFieldGrid|.

Fri Sep 25 14:19:23 PDT 1998

o Add function to check if point is valid. This is called
|pointOk| and it returns a |Code| object. See |difAlgebra/Code.hh|.

Here is table of failure codes so far implemented. New codes should
be entered in this table. Codes should not be reused

Code                  Failure mode
1301                  BFieldFringe called with |z|<0.5
1302                  BFieldFringe called with polar angle < 20 deg
1303                  BFieldInterator called beyond valid region

Fri Oct  2 11:49:00 PDT 1998

V00-00-22 16-Oct-1998  T.L. Geld      FIRST SRT VERSION: 7.5.0
- Update bp_bfld.F for new beamline geometry
- Add bp_fldval_quad.F for quadrapoles in new beamline geometry
- Add bp_fldval_her.F for quadrapoles in HER97 beamline geometry

Package dependencies:
  - gnbpip V00-04-04
  - gnbbg V00-05-20


V00-00-23 Tue Oct 20 14:45:59 PDT 1998

o New interface for |gufld96|. Subroutine |gufldopen("filename")|
must be called before using |gufld96|. This is done mainly to
regularize the c++ interface. Calling |gufld96| w/o this initialization
will probably cause a crash. Don't do it!

o GNUmakefile: testBField.o and checkBFieldBbsim.o are explicitly linked  
  since they are now in BINCCFILES. checkBFieldBbsim is referenced only in
  testBField.cc. checkBFieldBbsim can be put into libBField.a when it compiles.

  removed include "SoftRelTools/arch_spec_RW.mk", added 
  "override LINK_rw += BField" in link_BField.mk.

o fieldfile.inc added. This file contains the name of the field map file and
  the unit number.

Tue Nov 10 11:58:51 PST 1998


o Add Adam Boyarski's solenoidal field map model |bmap| and friends. 
Modified |BFieldSol| to use it instead of place holder routine |bfieldsol.F|.

o Deprecated |gufld94.F|. It can no longer be invoked.

o Add genoa field map file |bfield.dat|; it is being moved here from 
|gnbase/dat|.
