BbrGeom package README file


Depends on:
   gismo (for some implementations)
   G4Geom (for some implementations)
   CLHEP    (for utility classes, matrices and vectors)

Depended on by:
   lots of stuff, particularly AbsTrack


Notes on Contents:
    BbrAngle
	encapsulates an angle as a double, but limits the 
   	value to -pi to pi.  Also provides access to the
     	value in degrees and over the 0 to 2pi range.

	provides constants BbrAngle:pi, BbrAngle:twoPi to machine
	precision

   testBbrGeom is a simple test program, testBbrGeom.reference is
        an output for comparison

	Change BbrErrProjector::localError to STATIC, hide ctor.  New
	calling sequence is simpler:

	HepSymMatrix errInPlane;
	BbrErrProjector::Code code =
	   BbrErrProjector::localError(sigma,direction,uHat,vHat,errInPlane);

	Fix unary minus in *Err classes, fix rad <-> degree 
	conversion, update tests for *Err

New utility class BbrErrProjector added. Purpose is to project
errors on track position on to a plane, e.g., an RPC.

Calling sequence:

BbrErrProjector projector;

HepSymMatrix errInPlane;

BbrErrProjector::Code code=local(sigma,direction,uHat,vHat,errInPlane);

where sigma is the error on the position of the track transverse to
its direction evaluated at the intersection point, direction is the
direction of the track and uHat and vHat are define the local coordinate
system in the plane.

This version of the function deals only with a simple uncorrelated
error which is symmetrical around the track direction such as is typical
of multiple scattering dominated errors. I can supply a more general
purpose function in which sigma is replaced by a HepSymMatrix if a need
for it develops.
