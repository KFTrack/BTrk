File DchGeom.data (default geometry) is the new one.

geometry file needed by the old simulation events is now DchGeom_old.data, 
for new simulation events is DchGeom_new.data. File DchGeom.data (default 
geometry) is the old one.

The drift chamber geometry is read from a data file, DchGeom.data.  There 
are, as of today, two versions of the file in CVS: DchGeom.data, which 
represents what's in BBSim, and DchGeom.data_shouldBe, which represents 
Roberto Stroili's understanding of what the drift chamber design is 
supposed to be -- until the next time it changes.

Short description of file DchGeom.data

These are the data in the first line of the file:
------------------------------------------------
  cell height   ------------------
  chamber length (inner)         |
  z offset           |           |
        |            |           |
        
     36.699997  276.399994  1.179130


while these are the data relative to each layer (following lines):
(the radius is radius of center of layer, not sense wire)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

  offset in R of sense wire from center of layer --------------------------
  twist angle        ---------------------------------------------        |
  tan stereo angle   -------------------------------             |        |
  delta phi of cell # 0 center ----------          |             |        |
  radius @ endplate ------              |          |             |        | 
  # of wires per layer   |              |          |             |        |
  # layer     |          |              |          |             |        |  
       |      |          |              |          |             |        |
