This directory contains drift chamber data types as well
as procedures for construction digis from Monte Carlo input -
specifically |DchGLayHit|s.

Object				What it is and/or does

DchDigi				Drift chambers digis; includes constructors
				for producing simulated digi from geant
				hits.

DchGLayHit			Geant drift chamber layer hit. MC digis
				are produces from these.

DchGWirHit			Geant wire hit .. used by trigger group

DchGHit				New Geant hit from DchSimGeom

DchGeom				Drift chamber geometry but with lots of functions

DchHit				Vestigal - not used

DchLayer			Describes drift chamber layers

DchWire				Describes drift chamber wires

DchTrkSeg			Front end class of DchGLayHit with fucntions
				to calculate postion along segment, etc. 
				Extensive caching to keep speed up.

DchHit				A drift chamber fundamental hit for use by
				fitters; constructs from a |DchDigi| and caches
				assorted variables for speed in fitting, etc.

DchWireLayer			Flat wire-by-wire container for digis

glando				Landau fluctuation routine from |geant|

grndm				Random number generator for |glando|

DchDataHist			Test program for quality control. 

DchDebGeom			simple module to help debug the geometry

It contains also the geometry files (DchGeom.data, DchGeom_new.data,
DchGeom_old.data)
