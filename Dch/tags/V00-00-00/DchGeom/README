DchGeom Package

Authors: R. Stroili

This package provides the Dch geometry description based on the 
DetectorModel package.


=========================   LIST OF FILES   ===============================


DchCell:		Class that describes the layout of the cell in the
			layer. It uses the 6(7) field wires (|DchFWire|)
			for this purpose. It's supposed to give the path
			length of the track inside the cell.

			Also contains static functions to manipulate the
			cell identifier (LLWWW).

DchCellPlaneType:	Class needed to build the "planes" delimiting the
			cell boundaries (to intersect the tracjectory with
			the cell)

DchCylType:		Class needed to build the basic cylinder

DchDetector:		This class builds the geometry

DchFWire:		Field wire class (uses TrkLineTrajectories for the
			wire)

DchGDch:		Class used by |DchDetector| to get the parameters from 
			where to build the geometry. This class uses dbio
			functions or old-style ASCII files

DchGas:			

DchGasSet:

DchHyperType:		Hyperboloid type surface

DchHyperb:		Hyperboloid surface, describes the enevelop of the 
			stereo wires, it's used also for the axial ones as
			a cylindrical surface is a generalization of this

DchLayer:		Class mainly dealing with navigation stuff (for 
			track-finding), it also has the DchHyperb surface
			(for future use?)

DchSWire:		Sense wire class, it doesn't do much now

DchSWireElem:		Just a try, not used

DchSWireType:		Just a try, not used

DchSelections:		Selection functions

DchSet:			Not used

DchSuperLayer:		SuperLayer class, only for navigation staff, it has 
			nothing of the DetectorModel

DchVolElem:		Class needed to generate the Dch Gas Volume (for the 
			Kalman filter)

DchVolType:		Class needed to generate the Dch Gas Volume (for the 
			Kalman filter)

GenDchGeom:		test module
