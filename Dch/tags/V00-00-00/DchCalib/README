DchCalib -- Drift Chamber OFFLINE calibration software
------------------------------------------------------

Package Coordinator: Gerhard Raven (Gerhard.Raven@slac.stanford.edu)

This package implements the t->d calibration of the DCH.
The 'deliverable' of this package is the DchTimeToDistList,
which contains the DchTimeToDist objects for each individual
wire. The user retrieves a valid DchTimeToDistList through 
DchEnv using a proxy which lives in DchProxy. 

The DchTimeToDist objects 'know' how to:
   i) compute driftdistance, given drifttime, entrance angle,...
  ii) compute drifttime, given driftdistance, entrance angle,...
 iii) compute resolution, given driftdistance, entrance angle,...

The DchTimeToDist objects are implemented using 2 DchCalibFun's,
representing the t->d parameterization and the resolution, and a T0.
The 'bulk' of this package consists of different implementations
of DchCalibFuns...

FIXME:
This package should be split into two. It currently contains 
the abstract interface for calibration functions (DchCalibFun),
the 'deliverables' DchTimeToDist{,List} on the one hand, and on
the other hand ALL of the implementations of DchCalibFun's...
Those implementations should move out of this package...
