This package holds the code used to create the Kalman track
fit.  It includes a standalone module KalFit which can fit
all the tracks on a list (NOTE: KalFit makes no attempt to
determine whether a particular track on a fit already has a
Kalman Rep, instead it just refits all Tracks).  Kalman fits
can also be generated directly by other modules using the
KalMaker interface.  Kalman track information may be accessed
via the KalInterface and KalPairVisitor classes.

The basic Kalman fit now includes several types of 'sites':
KalMaterialSite.  This models energy loss and multiple scattering
  in materials.  It's connected to DetectorModel.
KalHitSite.  This is the Kalman wrapper to a TrkHitOnTrk.
KalBend.  This models the inhomogeneity of the BField.
  It's connected to BField and BFieldIntegrator.
KalConstraintSite.  This allows a (potentially partial) set of
  direct constraints on the tracking parameters to be modeled.
  It functions identically to a hit.
KalPairSite.  Used by KalPairRep to model the kinematic constraint
  at the juncture of the 2 tracks (see KalPairRep below).

This package also contains a few extensions to the basic Kalman
fit such as:
KalStub.  This is a special partial Kalman fit used in pattern
  recognition.
KalPairRep.  This is a special Kalman fit that can be applied
  to pairs of tracks having a known relative momentum coming
  from a common production point.  KalPairRep provides fully
  constrained information all along the full trajectory of the
  pair fit (IE much more information than a constrained vertex
  fit), and thus is appropriate for alignment studies.
